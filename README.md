## 📌 Features

✅ Add a new student with marks  
✅ Update student name  
✅ Update marks of a student  
✅ Generate report of all students  
✅ Generate report of a particular student  
✅ Automatic grade calculation  
✅ Rank students based on average marks

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Python Dictionaries  
- Lists  
- Functions  
- Loops  
- Conditional Statements  
- Sorting using Lambda Functions  
- Menu Driven Programming  

---

## 🗂 Data Structure Used

Student data is stored using a dictionary.

Example:

```python
{
    "Ajay": [97, 76, 88],
    "Vikruth": [69, 79, 87]
}
```

- **Key** → Student Name  
- **Value** → List of marks
